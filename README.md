A perfect Merkle binary tree has the following properties:
- The number of leaves is always 2^n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
- Each node has 0 or 2 children.
- All leaves are on the same level.

In a perfect binary tree the following formulas can be applied:
- Total number of leaves = L = (N + 1) / 2
- Total number of nodes = N 2L -1
- Total number of levels = 
  - LV = log2(L) + 1
  - LV = (Ln(L / Ln (2))) + 1
